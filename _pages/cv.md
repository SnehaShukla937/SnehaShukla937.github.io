Education
=========
* Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore (Aug. 2021 - present)
* M.Tech. in Information Technology, National Institute of Technology Raipur (July 2016- July 2018)
* B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication, Chhattisgarh Swami Vivekananda Technical University,Bhilai (Aug. 2011 - June 2015)


Project
=========
* Speech Recognition System
  * To tackle the problem of pronunciation in the English language, we have designed a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) \& Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based speech recognition system that can recognise recorded mispronounced words.
  * Stages Involved: Data prepossessing, MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) feature extraction, model training and testing.
  
* Impact of Feature Selection on EEG Based Motor Imagery, (July 2017 - July 2018)
  * Showing the impact of correlation and information gain based feature selection on Electroencephalogram (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) data for motor imagery task.
  * This work includes the extraction of short-time Fourier transform, wavelet and statistical features, selecting the relevant features, and classifying the selected features utilising machine learning.
