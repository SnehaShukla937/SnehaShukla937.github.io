      'bib_cease':'Although Deep Learning (DL)-based Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) models are critically important, adversarial attacks substantially diminish their efficacy. Such attacks subtly perturb inputs, causing the model to produce inaccurate predictions. This problem is more prevalent in medical images, as their intricate textures can mislead the model to focus on irrelevant regions, undermining performance and robustness. Thus, defending against adversarial attacks is crucial for a robust DL-based MIS model. While existing defences have proven effective in non-medical domains, their impact in medical domains remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel defence, CEASE (ContrastivE MultitASking DEfence), to significantly enhance the adversarial resilience of MIS models, delivering notable performance gain. CEASE exhibits contrastive learning, multitask learning, and their consolidation-based defence. Initially, we investigate the importance of contrastive learning in a DL-based MIS model. It leverages the observation that learning similar features for clean, adversarial, and augmented samples during training significantly enhances adversarial robustness. Subsequently, our proposed multitask learning-based defence provides generic feature representation and selects auxiliary tasks based on their weak relevance to the main task, improving model robustness. Eventually, we leverage the advantages of contrastive and multitask learning to propose their fusion-based defence. It employs contrastive learning specifically for MIS tasks and follows the proposed multitask model architecture. Experiments on publicly available datasets across several state-of-the-art MIS models reveal that CEASE surpasses the well-known defences by mitigating the efficacy of adversarial attacks up to 0% attack success rate on maximum average distortion with modest performance advancement.',
        
        'bib1': 'The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates avoiding skin contact to minimize the spread of virus infection. It paves the way for an active surge in telehealthcare research. In this direction, Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) plays a crucial role in analyzing heart rate (HR) from non-contact face videos. Existing rPPG-based HR monitoring methods fail when face video duration is small and the video contains facial deformations. These issues are mitigated by our proposed method HR-TRACK, that is, rPPG method for Heart Rate moniToring using tempoRAl Convolution networK. It improves HR monitoring by introducing a novel architecture formed by sequentially stacking two novel networks. The networks are inspired by the temporal convolution network (TCN) to model long temporal sequences effectively. Our first network automatically mitigates the noise induced by facial deformations and performs blind source separation to predict pulse signals. The instantaneous HR obtained from the pulse signal can be erroneous. Thus, our second network analyzes all the computed HR values and rectifies the erroneous HR, if any. The experimental results conducted on the publicly available datasets reveal that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the results justify the utilization of both networks to improve HR monitoring.',
          
          'bib2': 'Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) based medical image segmentation models have led to tremendous growth in healthcare applications. However, DL models can be easily compromised by intelligently engineered adversarial attacks, which pose a serious threat to the security of life-critical healthcare applications. Thus, understanding the generation of adversarial attacks is essential for designing robust and reliable DL based healthcare models. To this end, we explore adversarial attacks for medical image segmentation models in this paper. The adversarial attacks are performed by backpropagating the loss function, which minimises the error metrics. However, most of the medical image segmentation models utilise several non-differential loss functions, which obstruct the attack. Consequently, the attacks are performed by surrogate loss functions that are differentiable approximations of the original loss function. However, we observe that different surrogate loss functions behave differently for the same input. Hence, choosing the best surrogate loss function for a successful attack is crucial. Furthermore, these DL models contain non-differentiable layers that obfuscate gradients and obstruct the attack. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an attack, MedIS (Medical Image Segmentation), which utilises parallel fusion for selecting the best surrogate loss function with the least added perturbation. Moreover, our proposed MedIS attack also provides guidelines to tackle non-differentiable layers by replacing them with differentiable approximations. The experiments conducted on several well-known medical image segmentation models employing multiple surrogate loss functions reveal that MedIS outperforms existing attacks on medical image segmentation by providing a higher attack success rate.',

        'bib3': 'Despite the enormous achievements of Deep Learning (DL) based models, their non-transparent nature led to restricted applicability and distrusted predictions. Such predictions emerge from erroneous In-Distribution (ID) and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, which results in disastrous effects in the medical domain, specifically in Medical Image Segmentation (MIS). To mitigate such effects, several existing works accomplish OOD sample detection; however, the trustworthiness issues from ID samples still require thorough investigation. To this end, a novel method TrustMIS (Trustworthy Medical Image Segmentation) is proposed in this paper, which provides the trustworthiness and improved performance of ID samples for DL-based MIS models. TrustMIS works in three folds: IT (Investigating Trustworthiness), INT (Improving Non-Trustworthy prediction) and CSO (Classifier Switching Operation). Initially, the IT method investigates the trustworthiness of MIS by leveraging similar characteristics and consistency analysis of input and its variants. Subsequently, the INT method employs the IT method to improve the performance of the MIS model. It leverages the observation that an input providing erroneous segmentation can provide correct segmentation with rotated input. Eventually, the CSO method employs the INT method to scrutinise several MIS models and selects the model that delivers the most trustworthy prediction. The experiments conducted on publicly available datasets using well-known MIS models reveal that TrustMIS has successfully provided a trustworthiness measure, outperformed the existing methods, and improved the performance of state-of-the-art MIS models. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/SnehaShukla937/TrustMIS.',

        'bib4': 'Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are used by motor neuron disease patients for communication. The brain electroencephalogram signals, detected and recorded by BCI devices are used for analysis. The P300 component of event related potentials ERP used for the detection of attention towards a character is a popular approach. The first most successful speller device was proposed by Farewell and Donchin, named P300 speller. The device consists of 6 × 6 matrix of alpha-numeric with rows and columns randomly intensified, in order to generate a stimulus in the users brain for efficient use of BCI. In the presented work, overt and covert attention are recognised. Overt attention is being looked at with eye movement and covert attention is not associated with eye movement. Geometric speller has been used in this study; a comparative study of GeoSpeller and P300 speller is showed in covert and overt attention for analysis of both the methods and their usability.',

        'bib5': 'Heart rate (HR) is a crucial physiological indicator of human health and can be used to detect cardiovascular disorders. The traditional HR estimation methods, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmographs, require skin contact. Due to the increased risk of viral infection from skin contact, these approaches are avoided in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Alternatively, one can use the non-contact HR estimation technique, remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), wherein HR is estimated from the facial videos of a person. Unfortunately, the existing rPPG methods perform poorly in the presence of facial deformations. Recently, there has been a proliferation of deep learning networks for rPPG. However, these networks require large-scale labelled data for better generalization. To alleviate these shortcomings, we propose a method ALPINE, that is, A noveL rPPG technique for Improving the remote heart rate estimatioN using contrastive lEarning. ALPINE utilizes the contrastive learning framework during training to address the issue of limited labelled data and introduces diversity in the data samples for better network generalization. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid loss comprising contrastive loss, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss and data fidelity loss. Our novel contrastive loss maximizes the similarity between the rPPG information from different facial regions, thereby minimizing the effect of local noise. The SNR loss improves the quality of temporal signals, and the data fidelity loss ensures that the correct rPPG signal is extracted. Our extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method, ALPINE outperforms the previous well-known rPPG methods.',

        'bib6': 'Objective: the objective of the presented work is to analyse the electroencephalography signal based on brain computer interface by using P300 speller for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and perform classification on extracted features to get accuracy. Analysis/methods: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that involves the degeneration and death of nerve cell in the brain. It affects the process related to speech and loss of motor function in the patient. BCI technology is a communication solution for all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. The P300 speller included in the BNCI Horizon 2020 data is an application allows calculating the accuracy of classifier, which is necessary for the user to spell letters or sentences in a BCI speller paradigm. In this paper, we have extracted wavelet and power spectral density features. Association rule mining and ranking method is used for feature selection. For the classification, we have used multiple techniques and different classifiers and out of those, ten best techniques are selected based on their good performance. Finding: as a result, we get maximum 75% accuracy when we used random committee classifier.',

        'bib7': 'The purpose of this study is to identifying time series analysis and mathematical model fitting on electroencephalography channels that are placed on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients with P300 based brain-computer interface (BCI). Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron diseases are a rapidly progressing neurological disease that attacks and kills neurons responsible for controlling voluntary muscles. There is no cure and treatment effective to reverse, to halt the disease progression. A Brain- Computer Interface enables disable person to communicate & interact with each other and with the environment. To bypass the important motor difficulties present in ALS patient, BCI is useful. An input for BCI system is patients brain signals and these signals are converted into external operations, for brain signals detection, Electroencephalography (EEG) is normally used. P300 based BCI is used to record the reading of EEG brain signals with the help of non-invasive placement of channels. In EEG, channel analysis Autoregressive (AR) model is a widely used. In the present study, Yule-Walker approach of AR model has been used for channel data fitting. Model fitting as a form of digitization is majorly required for good understanding of the dataset, and also for data prediction. Fourth order of the mathematical curve for this dataset is selected. The reason is the high accuracy obtained in the 4th order of Autoregressive model (97.51±0.64). In proposed Auto Regressive (AR) model has been used for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patient data analysis. The 4th order of Yule Walker auto-regressive model is giving best fitting on this problem.',

        'bib8': 'An EEG based motor imagery translates the motor intention of any subject into control signal by classifying EEG data of different imagination tasks such as hand and feet movements. As indicated by study, it is found that there are almost around 1 in 50 individuals living with loss of motion roughly 5.4 million individuals. For this sort of inability, EEG based BCI for motor imagery of right hand and feet movement imagination is acquired and classified. Short time Fourier transform and wavelet features are extracted and classified with and without feature selection. Ranking method is used for feature selection. Both classification outcomes are comparatively analyzed and observed that there is an increment in classification accuracy when features are classified after feature selection.'
